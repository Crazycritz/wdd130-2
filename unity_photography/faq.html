                    <h3>Pricing</h3>
                    <p>What is the pricing or how much does it cost to have a photoshoot?
                        The pricing scales with the time we are hired to photoshoot and the number or size of the
                        photographs you
                        wish to have produced. On average a wedding is $2000-$3000, for family photos it is $200-$300
                        and for school
                        or graduation photos it is typically $100-$150. All prices vary according to customers needs but
                        we always
                        offer the best prices. Photos do come in different combos.</p>
