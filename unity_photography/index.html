                <h3>Hi, I'm Joshua!</h3>
                <p>I am an award-winning photographer who loves to capture the moments of others. I have always had a
                    passion
                    for photography and it has been in my family since my great grandfather. I have definitely been more
                    on the
                    creative/arty side growing up and going through high school. Growing up you would always see me with
                    a
                    camera. When I finished high school, I started Unity Photography with a couple of close friends and
                    it grew
                    to be what it is today. Our team at Unity works our hardest to provide you with the best pictures
                    for you to
                    cherish and share with others. We photoshoot weddings, family photos and school or graduations.
