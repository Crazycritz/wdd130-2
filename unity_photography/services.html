                <p>Your family is so important, that's why it is so vital for you to have photos of them. Family photos
                    connect
                    the past to the present. They hold stories and help us reflect on times past. Having family photos
                    also
                    helps preserve those in it for future generations to love and cherish. It allows you to look back on
                    your
                    life and the lives of your loved ones and stir up stories of years gone by.</p>

                <p>Life always goes by so quickly and many forget their youth or “good years”. Whether you are
                    graduating
                    or
                    are just taking a normal school photo, it is just so precious to capture your youth and school
                    years. The
                    time in your life will just fly by. School photos will show you how much you have grown. They will
                    remind
                    you of the amazing stories and fun times you had with friends. They will show you a different
                    era/phase in
                    your life.
